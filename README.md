# Optimisation-Recipe-dataset

To download dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alihassanrevel/recipes/download?datasetVersionNumber=1


 Here we explore the optimization models ( using PuLP):
 
 -- "Recipe Dataset_Optimisation--minimise sugar content among 1000 recipes": We look at first 1000 recipes trying to minimize the sugar intake
 satisfying the daily requirments of calories, cholesterol, protein and carbohydrates. 
 
 -- "Recipe Dataset_Optimisation--minimise sugar content among healthy and vegan recipes":We look at healthy and vegan recipes trying to minimize the sugar intake satisfying the daily requirments of calories, cholesterol, protein and carbohydrates. 
 
 -- "Recipe dataset_Optimisation- minimize cholesterol content among 5000 recipes":We look at first 5000 recipes trying to minimize the cholesterol intake satisfying the daily requirments of calories, sugar, protein and carbohydrates. 
 
 
 Process: 
 
 --Expolore the dataset and modify it (calculate proportions of calories, cholesterol, protein ,sugar and carbohydrates per serving) 
 --Set the objective function
 --Set constraints
 --Observe results 
 
 Limitations: 
 
 --Since the purpose of this excersise is to practice problem solving using the optimization functions (such as PuLP), results may not be logically the best solution. Further work may involve dataset modification.
